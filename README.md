## SUMMARY

- Due to increasing Inflation many women are looking for employment to support their family. Also, many women have lost their jobs due to the pandemic and are struggling to find a stable employment.
- The gender gap in employment is still high in various fields, where there are less resources for women to look for employment. 
- They often have limitations to search for jobs within their region of stay, and lack of resources that would help them connect with potential employers.
- Minimum pay, unsafe working conditions and risks of discrimination are other deterring factors. 
- **SHERO** app aims to bridge in the gaps between such women and potential employers. We are bringing in unique features that will help address the issues faced by rural and underprivileged women. 
    - Smart profiles for ease of access
    - Events and Groups for upskilling
    - Regional Language support
    - Grievance Platform with call-in feature
- The aim of this application is to increase the usability and ease of access to women in a wide range. 
- The Usecase can be further developed to collaborate with E-centres through website and call-me feature for people who do not have access for internet.
